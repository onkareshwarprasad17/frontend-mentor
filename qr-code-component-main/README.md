## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

To make the parent responsive as per it's children dimensions, we can give `css width: 'fit-content` and specify the required dimensions of the children eg. image element.

### Useful resources

- [MDN CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me in navigating through styling.
