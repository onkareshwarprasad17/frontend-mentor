## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- ✅ See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- ✅ Writing semantic HTML based on the content

## My process

I built the project using a mobile-first workflow, focusing on accessible interactive states and a clean, responsive layout.

### Built with

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- CSS (custom properties, Flexbox)
- Mobile First Workflow

### What I learned

- Implementing accessible focus states for keyboard navigation.
- Used semantic HTML5 elements for better document structure, and replaced generic divs with meaningful semantic elements

### Continued development

- Improve micro-interactions and consider ARIA attributes for richer accessibility.
